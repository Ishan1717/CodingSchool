###Create a text-based RPG combat program that allows choose a type of character and fight an enemy with a random character-type
#Program should greet user, show them the types of characters available along with their stats (or a brief description of them, your choice), and then prompt them to select one.
  #At least four different classes should exist with a general "Character" superclass.
#At this point, program should create an instance of the selected character as well as randomly-generated enemy for the player to fight.
  #random.uniform(0,1)

#The program then enters the combat phase.
#The player should be allowed to either Fight, Use a Skill (these skills may be made at your discretion), or to Defend. An attribute, speed, should determine who moves first.
#This continues until either the HP of the player or the enemy becomes equal to or less than 0, at which point a message indicating the result is immediately printed and the user is prompted to indicate whether they'd like to fight the same enemey, fight a different one,  choose a different class, or quit. 
#THe enemy will need to have some sort of discernment of how to act. The conditions on how an enemy chooses an act is up to you! One parameter: enemy should at least in part make a decision based on the last round.
